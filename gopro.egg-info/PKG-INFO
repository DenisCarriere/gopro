Description: # GoPro - Python API
        
        At the moment all testings are conducted with the newest version of the GoPro Hero 4.
        
        ## Install
        
        Easy install with Github or PyPi (Soon)
        
        Installing the **latest version from GitHub**.
        
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/DenisCarriere/gopro.git
        $ cd gopro
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Installing the **tested version from PyPi**.
        
        ```bash
        $ sudo pip install gopro
        ```
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        Once the installation is complete you are ready to start! :)
        
        Launch your favorite `ipython` or standard `python`
        
        ```
        >>> import gopro
        >>> camera = gopro.camera()
        >>> camera.photo()
        ```
        
        ## Camera modes
        
        Makes it easy to cycle threw each available modes.
        
        ```python
        camera.mode('burst')
        camera.mode('photo')
        camera.mode('timelapse')
        camera.mode('video')
        ```
        
        ## Locate (Beep! Beep!)
        
        Can't find your device?? Call the locate function and it will Beep endlessly until there is no more battery.
        
        To turn off the beeps, simply press the `mode` button on the device or use the `off` as a parameter.
        
        ```python
        camera.locate('on')
        camera.locate('off')
        ```
        
        ## Sleep
        
        The camera will turn itself off, the Wi-Fi will still be active.
        
        At the moment there is no working commands to turn the device back on.
        
        To reactivate the device, press the `mode` button.
        
        ```python
        camera.sleep()
        ```
        
        ## Delete Photos
        
        Might be useful to dump all those photos from your GoPro.
        
        **Warning** once you delete photos/videos you cannot retrieve them back.
        
        The `erase` function does the same as the delete all.
        
        ```python
        camera.erase()
        camera.delete_all()
        camera.delete_last()
        ```
        
        ## Debug
        
        Want to explore & troubleshoot the device a bit, you can retrieve the following properties from your device.
        
        ```
        camera.info
        camera.commands
        ```
